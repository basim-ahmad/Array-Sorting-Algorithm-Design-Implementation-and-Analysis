# Array Sorting Algorithm Design, Implementation, and Analysis

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of various array sorting algorithms. The project includes tasks related to designing and analyzing a custom sorting algorithm, as well as an experimental study comparing multiple sorting algorithms.

## Project Structure

- `CountingSort1.py`: Implementation of the counting sort algorithm for arrays with distinct elements.
- `CountingSort2.py`: Modified counting sort algorithm to handle arrays with duplicate elements.
- `sort_analysis.py`: Code for testing and comparing different sorting algorithms.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Sorting Algorithm Design and Analysis

#### Part 1: Distinct Elements

1. **Algorithm Design**: Implement the `CountingSort` algorithm to sort an array of distinct integers.
2. **Time Complexity Analysis**: Analyze the time complexity using O-notation.
3. **Space Complexity Analysis**: Determine the space complexity of the algorithm.
4. **Python Implementation**: Implement the algorithm in Python (`CountingSort1.py`) and test it with an array of 20 distinct elements.

#### Part 2: Handling Duplicate Elements

1. **Algorithm Modification**: Modify the `CountingSort` algorithm to handle arrays with duplicate elements.
2. **Time Complexity Analysis**: Analyze the time complexity of the modified algorithm.
3. **Space Complexity Analysis**: Determine the space complexity of the modified algorithm.
4. **Python Implementation**: Implement the modified algorithm in Python (`CountingSort2.py`) and test it with an array containing duplicates.

### Task 2: Experimental Study on Sorting Algorithms

#### Part 1: System Development

1. **Main Menu**: Create a system with a main menu for testing sorting algorithms.
    - **Option 1**: Test an individual sorting algorithm.
    - **Option 2**: Test multiple sorting algorithms.
    - **Option 3**: Exit.
2. **Individual Algorithm Testing**: Allow the user to select and test one of the following algorithms:
    - Selection sort
    - Insertion sort
    - Merge sort
    - Quick sort
    - Heap sort
    - Counting sort
3. **Multiple Algorithm Testing**: Test all sorting algorithms using the same array and compare their performance.

#### Part 2: Data Collection and Analysis

1. **Comparison Table**: Collect data on the number of comparisons and running time for each sorting algorithm over multiple runs and array sizes.
2. **Results Analysis**: Analyze the results to compare the performance of different sorting algorithms.
